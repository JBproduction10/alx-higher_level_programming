# <u>Python - Everything is object</u>

# This project is 99.9% quizes with almost no writable code. I learnt so many stuff by brainstorming with my peers the following:

<ul>
<li>Why Python programming is awesome</li>
<li>What is an object</li>
<li>What is the difference between a class and an object or instance</li>
<li>What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object</li>
<li>What is a reference</li>
<li>What is an assignment</li>
<li>What is an alias</li>
<li>How to know if two variables are identical</li>
<li>How to know if two variables are linked to the same object</li>
<li>How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)</li>
<li>What is mutable and immutable</li>
<li>What are the built-in mutable types</li>
<li>What are the built-in immutable types</li>
<li>How does Python pass variables to functions</li>
</ul>
